### üéØ Core 90-Day Roadmap Generator

```prompt
You are an expert language curriculum designer. Create a comprehensive 90-day roadmap for learning [TARGET_LANGUAGE] for a [BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED] learner. Break it down day by day, specifying:

1.  **Daily Vocabulary:** 5-10 words/phrases with a weekly theme (e.g., greetings, food, travel).
2.  **Grammar Topics:** One micro-topic per day, with a brief explanation.
3.  **Listening Exercises:** Specific podcast episodes (e.g., "Coffee Break [Language] S1E1"), YouTube channels, or audio resources.
4.  **Speaking Practice:** Concrete activities or self-talk prompts (e.g., "Describe your room aloud using prepositions").
5.  **Reading Materials:** Suggestions like news headlines, short stories, or graded readers.
6.  **Writing Exercises:** From simple sentences to short paragraphs.
7.  **A Daily Tip:** For improving fluency, retention, or motivation.

**Constraints:**
- The total daily time commitment should be 20-30 minutes of focused learning.
- Ensure a gradual progression where each week builds on the previous one.
- Include a review day every 5-6 days.
- Structure the 90 days into three 30-day phases with clear goals for each phase.
- Suggest specific, free online resources and apps where applicable.
- Make it practical and achievable for a self-learner.
